# Bobazing_project
Multi-page HTML and CSS code for a small boba shop in Gilbert, AZ. 
This project was done simply using HTML markup and CSS. Initially this website used alot of dark colors(think coffee and caramel) but after viewing it, it just seemed too, for lack of a better phrase..not fun to be on. I decide to incorporate light colored wood and colors that are in the actual Boba store. Soon to be added will be online ordering and once I can get enough photos from the owner, pictures of every drink for the menu.
